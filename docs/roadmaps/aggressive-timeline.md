# Realistic MVP Timeline: Production-Ready Pipeline in Six Weeks

This document outlines a pragmatic, test-driven engineering plan to deliver a production-grade, end-to-end data pipeline within six weeks. The timeline includes proper testing, basic monitoring, and realistic buffers for debugging complex distributed systems.

**Guiding Principles**: 
1. Build incrementally with testing at each stage
2. Include basic monitoring and alerting from day one
3. Allow time for inevitable AWS/networking debugging
4. Deliver a reliable, maintainable data product

## Key Success Factors

1. **Dedicated Team**: This timeline assumes 2-3 experienced engineers working full-time
2. **AWS Experience**: Team should have prior experience with ECS, Glue, and networking
3. **Quick Decision Making**: Avoid analysis paralysis - make decisions and iterate
4. **Daily Standups**: Quick sync to unblock issues immediately
5. **Incremental Delivery**: Each week should produce working, tested components

## What is Deferred (Post-MVP)

This pragmatic timeline focuses on delivering a reliable MVP. The following features are explicitly deferred:

### Phase 2 (Weeks 7-8):
- **Production Environment**: Full production deployment with enhanced security
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Grafana dashboards and custom metrics
- **Cost Optimization**: Fargate Spot, VPC Endpoints, S3 lifecycle tuning
- **Additional Data Sources**: MongoDB connector and streaming data
- **Data Catalog**: Business glossary and data discovery tools

### Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):
- **Advanced Data Quality**: Full dbt-expectations integration
- **Slim CI Pattern**: Only test modified dbt models in PRs
- **Lake Formation**: Fine-grained access control
- **Multi-Region**: Disaster recovery across regions
- **ML Platform**: SageMaker integration for model training
- **Self-Service**: Data source onboarding automation

### Future Enhancements:
- **Streaming Architecture**: Full Kinesis implementation
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Streaming analytics with Kinesis Analytics
- **Data Mesh**: Domain-oriented decentralized data ownership
- **FinOps**: Detailed cost attribution and optimization

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Week 3 Complexity**: Prefect on ECS is complex
   - Mitigation: Consider managed Prefect Cloud for MVP if timeline slips
   - Have AWS Solution Architect review the design

2. **Networking Issues**: VPC configuration often causes delays
   - Mitigation: Use AWS VPC wizard for initial setup
   - Keep detailed network diagrams updated

3. **IAM Permission Errors**: These can consume days of debugging
   - Mitigation: Start with broader permissions, tighten in Phase 2
   - Use CloudTrail to debug permission issues

4. **dbt/Athena Integration**: Less common than dbt/Snowflake
   - Mitigation: Prototype early in Week 1
   - Have fallback plan to use Redshift Serverless

## Definition of Done for MVP

The MVP is complete when:
1. ✅ FMP API data flows automatically from source to Gold zone nightly
2. ✅ Pipeline failures generate alerts to on-call engineer
3. ✅ API endpoint returns portfolio summary data with authentication
4. ✅ All infrastructure is defined as code and deployable via CI/CD
5. ✅ Basic monitoring shows pipeline health and data quality metrics
6. ✅ Documentation exists for operating and troubleshooting the pipeline
7. ✅ Load test proves system can handle 90 days of historical data
8. ✅ Disaster recovery procedure tested and documented

This timeline provides a realistic path to a production-grade data pipeline while maintaining quality and operational excellence.
