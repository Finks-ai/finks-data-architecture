# Agentic Programming Sessions for Claude Code

This guide provides a battle-tested approach to building the Finks data pipeline using Claude Code across 22 focused sessions over 6 weeks.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Principles

1. **Context-Focused Sessions**: Each session has a single, clear objective
2. **Dependency-Aware**: Explicit dependencies and parallel opportunities
3. **Test-Driven**: Every session includes testing in its time estimate
4. **Recovery-Ready**: Each session can be re-run or recovered
5. **Progress Tracking**: Clear validation gates and success metrics

## ðŸ“Š Session Overview

| Week | Sessions | Focus | Validation Gate |
|------|----------|-------|-----------------|
| 0 | [Preparation](./week-0-preparation.md) | Environment setup | AWS access working |
| 1 | [Sessions 1-4](./week-1-foundation.md) | Local dev, Pulumi, core AWS | Infrastructure deployed |
| 2 | [Sessions 5-7](./week-2-infrastructure.md) | ECS, RDS, CI/CD | Full infrastructure ready |
| 3 | [Sessions 8-11](./week-3-orchestration.md) | Prefect deployment | Prefect operational |
| 4 | [Sessions 12-14](./week-4-transformation.md) | dbt, Glue, data models | Transformation ready |
| 5 | [Sessions 15-18](./week-5-pipeline.md) | End-to-end pipeline | Pipeline working |
| 6 | [Sessions 19-22](./week-6-production.md) | API, monitoring, security | Production ready |

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress Tracking

### Session Status Indicators
- ðŸ”´ **Blocked**: Missing dependencies
- ðŸŸ¡ **Ready**: Dependencies met, can start
- ðŸŸ¢ **Complete**: Finished with tests passing
- ðŸ”µ **In Progress**: Currently active
- âšª **Optional**: Can be deferred

```

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Complete [Week 0 Preparation](./week-0-preparation.md)** - Set up your environment
2. **Review the dependency graph** - Understand session relationships
3. **Start with Week 1** - Follow sessions in order within each week
4. **Track your progress** - Use the checklist above
5. **Save session outputs** - Each session should produce git commits

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices

### Before Each Session
1. Review the session's dependencies
2. Prepare the context prime for Claude
3. Ensure required resources are available
4. Have the previous session's handoff ready

### During Each Session
1. Start with the context prime
2. Follow the specific tasks in order
3. Test frequently
4. Commit working code often

### After Each Session
1. Document what was completed
2. Note any issues or blockers
3. Prepare handoff for next session
4. Update the progress checklist

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Session taking too long**: Break it into smaller parts
- **Dependencies not met**: Review the dependency graph
- **Claude losing context**: Use the handoff documentation
- **Tests failing**: Focus on one test at a time

### Recovery Strategies
- Each session is designed to be re-runnable
- Use git branches for experimental changes
- Keep detailed notes on what worked
- Don't hesitate to adjust time estimates
